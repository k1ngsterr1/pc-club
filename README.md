## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (recommended for package management)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for running the project)

## Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k1ngsterr1/pc-club.git
cd pc-club
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

#### Explanation of `yarn install`:

- **Purpose:** Installs all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, ensuring your project has the required libraries to run.
- **Benefits of Yarn:** Yarn is faster than npm due to its caching and parallel downloads. It also creates a `yarn.lock` file to maintain consistent installations across environments.

### 3. Start the App

To start the application, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox for trying out app development with Expo.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
